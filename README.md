# CS 202: Fundamental Structures of Computer Science II
*Course Description:*

The course picks up from where CS 201 left by discussing concepts related to algorithmic efficiency on basic abstract data types and some sorting algorithms that utilize recursion. Then, the course introduces the abstract data types of trees, tables, priority queues, and graphs, and shows how one can implement them in C++ using fundamental data structures by emphasizing run-time complexity analysis.
